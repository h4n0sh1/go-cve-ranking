# go-cve-ranking

This little program aims to provide a quick ranking on the CVE that targets a specific piece or group of software (based on your keyword search).

The ranking system is based on the same scheme Mitre uses for it's Top 40 [(More detail)](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2020/2020_cwe_top25.html#methodology), with some
specifities around the tie breakers.
